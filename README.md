The aim of this projct is creating a function called get_next_line() in which when it's called in a loop, it'll read the text within the file descriptor one line at a time until the end of the file.

### About get_next_line() 

- The function works both when reading a file and when reading from the standard input.
- The project return value is the line that was read. However, If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it returns NULL.
- The returned line includes the terminating \n character except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.

## Step for compiling the project:

- cd get_next_line

- touch 42.txt (txt file should be created so the project finds the file to read from)

- cc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -D BUFFER_SIZE=n <file.c>

compiler call: -D BUFFER_SIZE=n
will define the buffer size for read().
